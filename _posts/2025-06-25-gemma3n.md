Google DeepMind just released the new [Gemma 3n](https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/gemma-3n/) family of models. They are open-weight models, support multimodality natively, and come in sizes of 4B, 12B and 27B parameters. The [developer guide](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/) has some more details on that.

Something cool to look for in the announcement video (at 0:47) is the computer control demo that I both worked on and recorded:

The demo also shows some fun pictures that I took on hikes here in Switzerland to fill up the screen besides the recipe photo that is used in the demo.

Who would have thought that my hiking photos from Lugano, Pilates and Uri would ever make it into a Google announcement.
